Game Initialization:
- Create a list of words
- Select a random word from the list
- Set max attempts (e.g., 6)
- Initialize guessed letters as an empty list

Display Hangman:
- Create ASCII art for each part of the hangman (head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg)
- Create a variable to keep track of the current state of the hangman (e.g., starting with an empty hangman)

Gameplay Loop:
While max attempts > 0:
    - Display the current state of the hangman
    - Display the word with underscores and filled-in letters based on guessed letters
    - Display the number of attempts left

    Guess a Letter:
    - Ask the player for a letter guess
    - Validate the input (single character, not guessed before)

    Check in Word:
    - If the guessed letter is in the word:
        - Update the displayed word to reveal the guessed letter at the correct positions

    Incorrect Guess Handling:
    - If the guessed letter is not in the word:
        - Decrement max attempts
        - Add the corresponding part to the hangman

    Win/Lose Condition:
    - If the displayed word matches the target word:
        - Display a victory message
        - Break out of the loop (game over)
    - If max attempts reach 0:
        - Display a defeat message
        - Display the correct word
        - Break out of the loop (game over)

Game Termination:
- Ask the player if they want to play again
