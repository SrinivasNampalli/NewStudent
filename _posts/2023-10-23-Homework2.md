    <h2>Hack #1: Palindrome Checker</h2>
    <pre>
        <code>
def is_palindrome(input_string):
    input_string = input_string.replace(" ", "").lower()
    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse
    input_string = input("Enter a string: ")
    if is_palindrome(input_string):
        print("It's a palindrome!")
    else:
        print("It's not a palindrome.")
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Hack #2: Bubble Sort</h2>
    <pre>
        <code>
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    players = [8.25, 8.50, 8.10, 8.30, 8.20, 8.40, 8.15, 8.35, 8.60, 8.05]
    bubble_sort(players)
    print("Sorted list of average meters jumped:")
    for i, player in enumerate(players, start=1):
        print(f"Player {i}: {player} meters")
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Varibles</h2>
    <pre>
        <code>
num1Int = 10
num2Int = 20

sum_result = num1Int + num2Int

print("The sum of", num1Int, "and", num2Int, "is:", sum_result)

float1 = 3.5
float2 = 2.0

quotient = float1 / float2

print("The quotient of", float1, "and", float2, "is:", quotient)

message = "My name is {} and I am a {}."

name = "Srinivas"
occupation = "software engineer"

formatted_message = message.format(name, occupation)
print(formatted_message)

Variable algorithms and searching algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and play a vital role in solving a wide range of problems efficiently.

Variable Algorithms:
Variable algorithms allow developers to write flexible and adaptable code. They provide a way to handle varying data and situations without modifying the core algorithm. Instead, the algorithm adapts based on specific inputs. This adaptability is achieved through the use of variables and conditional statements. For instance, in sorting algorithms, variables determine how elements are compared and swapped, allowing the algorithm to work with various data types and sort orders. Variable algorithms are crucial for building dynamic software systems that can handle unpredictable scenarios.

Searching Algorithms:
Searching algorithms are designed to locate a specific item within a dataset. They are employed extensively in applications like databases, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence. Searching can be done sequentially (linear search) or by dividing the dataset into smaller portions (binary search for ordered lists). Searching algorithms have a significant impact on performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. Efficient searching is crucial for user experience in applications like search engines and e-commerce websites.
