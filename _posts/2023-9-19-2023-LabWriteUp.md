# Program Function and Purpose


## Program with Output

- This code outputs the first 10 numbers of Fibonacci series.


```python
# Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
a, b = 0, 1

# Number of Fibonacci numbers to be printed
n = 10

print("First", n, "Fibonacci numbers:")

for _ in range(n):
    print(a)
    a, b = b, a + b
```

    First 10 Fibonacci numbers:
    0
    1
    1
    2
    3
    5
    8
    13
    21
    34


## Program with input and Output

- This program gets input of User's name and outputs a greeting.


```python
# Input: Ask the user for their name
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# Process: Create a personalized greeting
greeting = f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to our program."

# Output: Display the personalized greeting
print(greeting)

```

    Hello, Nitin! Welcome to our program.


## Program with List

- This is my list of of fruits. Here, I display many different functions with lists. 


```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Display the list
print("Original list:", fruits)

# Add an item to the list
fruits.append("elderberry")
print("After adding an item:", fruits)

# Remove an item from the list
fruits.remove("cherry")
print("After removing an item:", fruits)

# Reverse the list
fruits.reverse()
print("Reversed list:", fruits)

# Sort the list
fruits.sort()
print("Sorted list:", fruits)

# Find the index of an item
index = fruits.index("date")
print("Index of 'date':", index)

# Insert an item at a specific position
fruits.insert(2, "fig")
print("After inserting an item:", fruits)

# Count occurrences of an item
count = fruits.count("apple")
print("Count of 'apple':", count)

# Clear the list
fruits.clear()
print("After clearing the list:", fruits)


```

    Original list: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
    After adding an item: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
    After removing an item: ['apple', 'banana', 'date', 'elderberry']
    Reversed list: ['elderberry', 'date', 'banana', 'apple']
    Sorted list: ['apple', 'banana', 'date', 'elderberry']
    Index of 'date': 2
    After inserting an item: ['apple', 'banana', 'fig', 'date', 'elderberry']
    Count of 'apple': 1
    After clearing the list: []


## Program with Dictionary

- This is my dictionary. Here, I display many different functions with lists. 


```python
# Create a dictionary
person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Accessing elements
print(person["name"])  # Output: John
print(person.get("age"))  # Output: 30

# Adding elements
person["job"] = "Engineer"
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'job': 'Engineer'}

# Removing elements
del person["age"]
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'city': 'New York', 'job': 'Engineer'}

# Iterating through a dictionary
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

# Checking if a key exists
if "city" in person:
    print(f"City is: {person['city']}")  # Output: City is: New York

# Dictionary length
print(len(person))  # Output: 3

# Nested dictionaries
person['address'] = {
    'street': '123 Main St',
    'zipcode': '10001'
}
print(person['address']['street'])  # Output: 123 Main St

```

    John
    30
    {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'job': 'Engineer'}
    {'name': 'John', 'city': 'New York', 'job': 'Engineer'}
    name: John
    city: New York
    job: Engineer
    City is: New York
    3
    123 Main St


## Program with Iteration

- This is my function of factorial using iteration in the form of for loops.


```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Get input from the user
num = int(input("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: "))

# Check if the number is negative, zero, or positive
if num < 0:
    print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
    print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}")
```

    The factorial of 4 is 24


## Program with a Function to perform mathematical and/or a statistical calculations.

- This my program that offers the user a choice to perform either a mathematical calculation (like square root) or a statistical calculation (like mean of a list of numbers).


```python
import math

def calculate_square_root(number):
    """Return the square root of the given number."""
    return math.sqrt(number)

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    """Return the mean of a list of numbers."""
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Display options to the user
print("Choose an operation:")
print("1. Calculate Square Root")
print("2. Calculate Mean of a List of Numbers")
    
choice = int(input("Enter your choice (1/2): "))

if choice == 1:
    number = float(input("Enter the number to find its square root: "))
    print(f"Square root of {number} is {calculate_square_root(number)}")
elif choice == 2:
    numbers = list(map(float, input("Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()))
    print(f"Mean of the given numbers is {calculate_mean(numbers)}")
else:
    print("Invalid choice!")
```

    Choose an operation:
    1. Calculate Square Root
    2. Calculate Mean of a List of Numbers
    Square root of 25.0 is 5.0


## Program with Selection/Condition

- The code determines and displays the appropriate ticket type and its cost based on the user's age input.


```python
def determine_ticket_type(age):
    """Determine the type of ticket based on age."""
    if age < 5:
        return "Toddler Ticket - Free"
    elif age < 13:
        return "Child Ticket - $5"
    elif age < 60:
        return "Adult Ticket - $10"
    else:
        return "Senior Ticket - $7"

# Get age input from the user
try:
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    print("Age " + str(age))
    # Determine and print the ticket type
    print(determine_ticket_type(age))
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid age.")


```

    Age 10
    Child Ticket - $5


## Program with Purpose

- This code gets and input of city and outputs the weather in that city.


```python
import requests

API_KEY = '2f154dace08459a35fe9522ff7de936d'
BASE_URL = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?"

def get_weather(city_name):
    complete_url = BASE_URL + "q=" + city_name + "&appid=" + API_KEY
    response = requests.get(complete_url)
    data = response.json()

    if data["cod"] != 404:
        main_data = data["main"]
        weather_data = data["weather"][0]
        temperature = main_data["temp"] - 273.15  # Convert Kelvin to Celsius
        humidity = main_data["humidity"]
        weather_description = weather_data["description"]

        return (f"Weather in {city_name}:\n"
                f"Temperature: {temperature:.2f}°C\n"
                f"Humidity: {humidity}%\n"
                f"Description: {weather_description.capitalize()}")
    else:
        return "City Not Found!"

city_name = input("Enter city name: ")
print(get_weather(city_name))

```

    Weather in London:
    Temperature: 18.60°C
    Humidity: 84%
    Description: Broken clouds

Program: List Calculation

Description:
    This Python program takes a list of numbers, iterates through it, and performs two calculations:
    1. It calculates the sum of all even numbers in the list.
    2. It calculates the product of all odd numbers in the list.

Usage:
    1. Define a list of numbers in the 'numbers' variable.
    2. The program will iterate through the list and perform the calculations.
    3. The results (sum of even numbers and product of odd numbers) will be displayed.

Example:
    If the 'numbers' list contains [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the program will output:
    Sum of even numbers: 30
    Product of odd numbers: 945
"""

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Initialize variables for sum of even numbers and product of odd numbers
even_sum = 0
odd_product = 1

# Iterate through the list and perform calculations
for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
        even_sum += number
    else:
        odd_product *= number

# Print the results
print("Sum of even numbers:", even_sum)
print("Product of odd numbers:", odd_product)

```

    Sum of even numbers: 30
    Product of odd numbers: 945
