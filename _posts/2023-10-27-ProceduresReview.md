    <h1>Reflection on Python Libraries</h1>
    <p>Libraries in Python play a crucial role in simplifying complex tasks and expanding functionality. Through this exploration, I've come to appreciate the power of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.</p>
    
    <p><strong>NumPy</strong>, with functions like <code>np.array()</code> and <code>np.mean()</code>, empowers efficient manipulation of arrays and numerical operations. <strong>Pandas</strong>, exemplified by the DataFrame and <code>read_csv()</code>, simplifies data handling, making it ideal for data analysis and manipulation.</p>

    <p><strong>Matplotlib</strong>'s <code>plt.plot()</code> and <code>plt.xlabel()</code> create compelling visualizations, enhancing data interpretation. This journey helped me understand the practicality of these libraries in real-world projects.</p>

    <h2>Matplotlib Example:</h2>
    <pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 15, 13, 18, 20]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.show()</code></pre>

    <p>These libraries have broadened my Python capabilities, making complex data tasks manageable and enabling the creation of insightful visualizations. This newfound knowledge will undoubtedly prove invaluable in future projects.</p>
