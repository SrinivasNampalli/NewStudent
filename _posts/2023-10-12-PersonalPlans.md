    <h1>Project Progress Updates</h1>
    <p><strong>Week 1:</strong> General Prototype was founded and had an overall understanding of what it was going to be like. Nitin committed and pushed it into the main.</p>
    <p><strong>Week 2:</strong> I worked on some more animation features, and in the end, we came together and attempted to figure out how the colleges would be recommended to each other.</p>
    <p><strong>Week 3:</strong> Collaborating with Nitin, we came to a consensus and knew that with simple if statements we could refer to our database and easily find code that works perfectly.</p>
    <p><strong>Week 4:</strong> This was the "Night at the Museum" week, and we are officially done. The backend was running fine, and this seemed to be an anticipated feature from many.</p>
