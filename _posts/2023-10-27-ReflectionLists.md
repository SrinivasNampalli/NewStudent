    <title>Reflection on Recursion and Iteration</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        Recursion and iteration are fundamental concepts in programming, each with its unique strengths and use cases. Recursion involves a function calling itself to solve a problem, breaking it down into simpler subproblems. It often leads to elegant and concise code but can be less efficient due to multiple function calls. Iteration, on the other hand, uses loops to repeat a set of instructions, making it more efficient and easier to understand for many tasks.

        Choosing between recursion and iteration depends on the problem's nature and complexity. Recursion is well-suited for problems with a recursive structure, while iteration shines when simplicity, performance, and predictability are essential. Understanding both approaches equips a programmer with versatile problem-solving tools for different situations.
