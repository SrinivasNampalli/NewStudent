Question 6: Directions: The question or incomplete statement below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case.

A smartphone stores the following data for each photo that is taken using the phone.

The file name of the photo
The date and time the photo was taken
The geographic location where the photo was taken
Assume that all of the photos that have been taken on the phone are accessible. Which of the following can be determined using the photo data described above?

      I. The number of photos that were taken at a particular geographic location
     II. The number of photos that were taken in the last year
    III. The name of the person who took the most recent photo

The answer I wrote was wrong was because I need to consider the fact there is also a posbilility that the number of photos and the year the photos where taken needs to be seen. 

Question: 20
Directions: The question or incomplete statement below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case.

An application program interface (API) provides a procedure Max, which returns the greater of its two integer arguments.

A programmer would like to find the greatest of three integer values a, b, and c. Which of the following expressions will produce the desired result in every case?

I have to be much more careful and make sure that my code is fully showing through and that I am perfectly taking max of (a,b) first and knowing that this operation happens first.

Question 25: Byte pair encoding is a data encoding technique. The encoding algorithm looks for pairs of characters that appear in the string more than once and replaces each instance of that pair with a corresponding character that does not appear in the string. The algorithm saves a list containing the mapping of character pairs to their corresponding replacement characters.

For example, the string Open quotation, THIS, underscore, IS, underscore, THE, underscore, BEST, underscore, WISH, close quotation can be encoded as Open quotation, percent, hash, underscore, hash, underscore, percent E, underscore, BEST, underscore, W, hash, H, close quotation by replacing all instances of Open quotation, T H, close quotation with Open quotation, percent, close quotationand replacing all instances of Open quotation, I S, close quotation with Open quotation, hash, close quotation.

Which of the following statements about byte pair encoding is true?

Byte pair encoding is an example of a lossless transformation because an encoded string can be restored to its original version.This option is correct. The transformation is lossless because an encoded string can be restored to its original version. For example, Open quotation, percent, hash, underscore, hash, underscore, percent E, underscore, BEST, underscore, W, hash, H, close quotation can be restored to Open quotation, THIS, underscore, IS, underscore, THE, underscore, BEST, underscore, WISH, close quotation by replacing all instances of Open quotation, percent, close quotationwith Open quotation, T H, close quotation and by replacing all instances of Open quotation, hash, close quotation with Open quotation, I S, close quotation.

Question 42: Directions: The question or incomplete statement below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case.

Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) represents each IP address as a 32-bit binary number. Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) represents each IP address as a 128-bit binary number. Which of the following best describes the result of using 128-bit addresses instead of 32-bit addresses?
2 raised to the ninety sixth power times as many addresses are available.This option is correct. With 32-bit addressing, IPv4 has 2 raised to the thirty second power possible addresses. With 128-bit addressing, IPv6 has 2 raised to the one hundred twenty eighth power possible addresses. Since 2 raised to the thirty second power times 2 raised to the ninety sixth power equals 2 raised to the one hundred twenty eighth power, IPv6 has 2 raised to the ninety sixth power times as many possible addresses as IPv4.

Question 59:
Directions: The question or incomplete statement below is followed by four suggested answers or completions. Select the one that is best in each case.

A media librarian at a movie studio is planning to save digital video files for archival purposes. The movie studio would like to be able to access full-quality videos if they are needed for future projects. Which of the following actions is LEAST likely to support the studioâ€™s goal?

The idea of lossy compression is something I need to study.
Using lossy compression software to reduce the size requirements of the data being stored. This option is correct. Using lossy compression will provide only an approximation of the original video data. The full-quality original versions of the videos will be lost if lossy compression is used.


Question 60:Directions: For the question or incomplete statement below, two of the suggested answers are correct. For this question, you must select both correct choices to earn credit. No partial credit will be earned if only one correct choice is selected. Select the two that are best in each case.

Which of the following are ways in which a programmer can use abstraction to manage the complexity of a program?

Select two answers.
A,D. The procedure is much more easy to code in this example.
