Reflection on Recursion and Iteration

Recursion and iteration are essential programming concepts. Recursion involves a function calling itself to break down problems, while iteration uses loops. Recursion can be elegant but less efficient. Iteration is more straightforward and efficient for repetitive tasks.

Code Example 1 - Recursion:

python
Copy code
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
Code Example 2 - Iteration:

python
Copy code
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
These approaches offer versatility in problem-solving, with recursion tackling recursive problems and iteration handling repetitive tasks efficiently. Understanding when to use each is a valuable skill in programming.
