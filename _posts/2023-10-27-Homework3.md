    <h2>Reflection on Recursion and Iteration</h2>
    <p>Recursion and iteration are essential programming concepts. Recursion involves a function calling itself to break down problems, while iteration uses loops. Recursion can be elegant but less efficient. Iteration is more straightforward and efficient for repetitive tasks.</p>

    <h3>Code Example 1 - Recursion:</h3>
    <pre><code>def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Code Example 2 - Iteration:</h3>
    <pre><code>def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
    </code></pre>

    <p>These approaches offer versatility in problem-solving, with recursion tackling recursive problems and iteration handling repetitive tasks efficiently. Understanding when to use each is a valuable skill in programming.</p>
